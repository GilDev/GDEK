# GDEK: Your first ergonomic keyboard

Want to try ergonomic keyboards? Don’t know where to start? Don’t want to break the bank yet before knowing what you really want? This may be the keyboard for you.

I created this keyboard following [a little crowdfunding campaign](https://fr.ulule.com/clavier-ergonomique-gildev/) I ran for people that were interested in improving their typing comfort but didn’t want to spend too much money on a device they might not like or would like some feature. This keyboard was entirely designed from scratch, after experimenting for some years with a TypeMatrix 2030, a original X-Bows (Kickstarter edition) and a personnal variant of the Sofle Choc RGB.

* **4×6 matrix**: you don’t risk missing anything, you can always disable things later on in software to see if missing that top number row would work for you. You can even type in [Bépo](https://bepo.fr/) with minimal modifications!
* **Split**: optimal hands placement, with room in the middle for a trackball or Magic Trackpad, and a simple audio cable to connect the two halves with connectors that won’t mechanically constrain your cable
* **Compact**: despite the “full” matrix, it’s easy to bring it along
* **5 keys thumb cluster**: enough for anything you could imagine
* **Supports MX, Kailh Choc and Gateron KS-33 low-profile switches**: I personnaly use KS-33 switches as they’re low-profile, cheap and support standard MX-compatible keycaps
* **Per-key RGB**: more than just for looks, they can indicate what some keys do, which layer you’re on, etc.
* **Encoder**: you may think it’s a gimmick, but at least you can try it and see if you like it. I love it to scroll, move the cursor, control volume, etc.
* **RP2040**: a very cool and powerful microcontroller that will support any features you could image without breaking a sweat. Easy to flash: it appears like a USB drive that you can drag the firmware onto
* **QMK firmware with VIA support**: easily configurable and customizable via a web app
* **Assembly-friendly**: send the PCB to be assembled and just solder the switches, encoders and audio TRS jack (pretty easy)
* **Open-source**: you can modify the design to your liking, design a case and so on
